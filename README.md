### snps-to-2dcnn-converter ###

**Description**

- Convert SNPs into 2DCNN
- Understand genotype-phenotype relationships using SNP conversion
- Predict drug resistance in E. coli using the same methodology

**Dataset**

Unlabeled: The original dataset is 1GB in size. I have created 10 sample datasets using a splitter. The first sample is available as "core_gene_alignment.aln.partaa".

Original Dataset Name: Core_gene_alignment.aln. (To be published in the cloud soon)

`` The script(spliter.sh) is designed to split the dataset into smaller parts due to the original dataset exceeding the maximum storage capacity.``

```bash
chmod +x spliter.sh
./spliter.sh
```
